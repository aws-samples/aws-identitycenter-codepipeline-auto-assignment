# AWS Identity Center Automation Performance Optimization Recommendations

## Key Performance Bottlenecks

1. **Sequential API Calls**
   - Both `auto-permissionsets.py` and `auto-assignment.py` make sequential AWS API calls within loops
   - Each permission set operation and account assignment waits for completion before proceeding
   - No parallel processing is utilized for independent operations

2. **Redundant Data Retrieval**
   - Account and permission set data is repeatedly queried
   - Same data is fetched multiple times within loops

3. **Inefficient Loops and Operations**
   - Nested loops without early exits
   - Multiple passes over the same data
   - String comparisons and data transformations performed repeatedly

## Recommended Optimizations

### 1. Implement Parallel Processing

```python
# Add concurrent.futures for parallel processing
import concurrent.futures
```

#### Permission Sets Management
- Parallelize permission set operations that are independent:
  - Creation of new permission sets
  - Policy attachments
  - Permission set updates
  - Provisioning to accounts

#### Account Assignments
- Process multiple account assignments concurrently:
  - Group assignments by target account
  - Process assignments for different accounts in parallel
  - Use thread pools for API calls

### 2. Cache and Optimize Data Access

```python
# Implement caching for frequently accessed data
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def get_permission_set_arn(permission_set_name, current_aws_permission_sets):
    # Existing implementation
    pass

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def get_valid_group_id(group_name):
    # Existing implementation
    pass
```

- Cache permission set ARNs and metadata
- Cache account IDs and status
- Cache group IDs and names
- Implement batch operations where possible

### 3. Optimize Loop Operations

Current problematic pattern:
```python
for each_assignment in check_list:
    for global_mapping in global_file_contents:
        for each_perm_set_name in global_mapping['PermissionSetName']:
            # ... operations
```

Recommended pattern:
```python
# Pre-process data into optimized structures
permission_set_map = {
    (mapping['GlobalGroupName'], perm_set): mapping
    for mapping in global_file_contents
    for perm_set in mapping['PermissionSetName']
}

# Single-pass processing
for assignment in check_list:
    key = (assignment['PrincipalId'], assignment['PermissionSetArn'])
    if key in permission_set_map:
        # Process match
        continue
```

### 4. Batch API Operations

```python
def batch_create_assignments(assignments, batch_size=20):
    """Process assignments in batches"""
    for i in range(0, len(assignments), batch_size):
        batch = assignments[i:i + batch_size]
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(create_single_assignment, assignment)
                      for assignment in batch]
            concurrent.futures.wait(futures)
```

### 5. Implement Early Exit Conditions

```python
def process_mappings(mappings, target):
    """Process mappings with early exits"""
    for mapping in mappings:
        if not mapping_applies_to_target(mapping, target):
            continue
        # Process valid mapping
```

### 6. Reduce API Wait Times

- Implement batch status checking for operations
- Use exponential backoff for status checks
- Aggregate similar operations

Example batch status check:
```python
def check_assignment_status_batch(request_ids):
    """Check status for multiple assignments at once"""
    incomplete = set(request_ids)
    while incomplete:
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(check_single_status, req_id)
                      for req_id in incomplete]
            for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
                if future.result() == 'SUCCEEDED':
                    incomplete.remove(future.result())
        if incomplete:
            time.sleep(2)  # Exponential backoff should be implemented
```

## Implementation Priority

1. Parallel processing for independent operations
2. Data caching and optimization
3. Loop optimization and data structure improvements
4. Batch operations implementation
5. Status check optimization

## Additional Considerations

1. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper retry mechanisms
   - Handle API throttling
   - Track failed operations for retry

2. **Memory Management**
   - Clear caches periodically
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Implement pagination for large datasets

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add performance metrics
   - Track execution times
   - Monitor API call patterns

4. **Testing**
   - Benchmark different batch sizes
   - Test with various account scales
   - Validate concurrent operations

Implementation of these optimizations could potentially reduce execution time by 60-80% depending on
the number of accounts and permission sets being processed.
